	Third button will be clicked to start the game. click function will be added to run the first loop of the random pattern using some kind of % loop/ switch statement?  



Interactivity:
	create a container to hold the four squares 

	create a box class to put inside of four <div>'s 

	create specific classes for the colors of the boxes and additional styling wanted 

	create click functions for the buttons to light up (change color fade in when clicked and/or look up a click statement that will allow the button to become brighter. 

	Create a loop that will run through the variables of the buttons while randomizing a pattern. 

	Create and If/ Else statement that will say if buttons are clicked in the correct order, they will continue with the new extended pattern. ---- link the up, down, left, right and space bar keys to the boxes that are clicked.

		console.log the buttons that are clicked ---- need to create an array that will show the index pattern and match it with the original pattern shown. if (i == ) 

			create click functions for the buttons to light up (change color fade in when clicked and/or look up a click statement that will allow the button to become brighter.
